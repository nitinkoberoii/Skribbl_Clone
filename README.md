# scribbl_clone

This project is a clone of Skribbl.io, which is a word guessing game.

## Getting Started

This project was made as a part of learning Full-Stack App Development using MongoDB, Express.js, Flutter, Node.js.
The credit for this application belongs to Rivaan Ranawat.

Additional dart packages to be installed to run this application are:
- socket_io_client

The packages that were installed using npm are:
- axios
- express
- http
- mongoose
- socket_io

Also, there wil be a need for downgrading your socket.io version to 2.3.0 .
Now, there is a problem with the version compatibility of dart's socket_io_client and node's socket.io .
